Please find description of folders below.

 1. deploy - A runnable jar file for running the project.
 2. docs - A document detailing steps to import code to local workspace and run it locally. 
           I added a few test cases as well with results in the same document. 
 3. mask-api-services-master - project folder where source code of executable jar is placed.
